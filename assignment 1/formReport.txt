### Report: User Registration Landing Page

---

This assignment creates a simple user registration page using HTML5. The page includes a form to collect a user's **Full Name**, **Email**, **Phone Number**, and **Password**.

---

**Page Structure:**
- <Header>: Contains the page title and basic navigation links.
- <Main>: The registration form where users fill in their details.
- <Footer>: Displays a copyright message.

---

**Code Features:**
-  <HTML5>: Uses `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for structure.
- **Accessibility**: Labels are included for form fields to assist screen readers.
- **Validation**: Basic HTML5 validation (e.g., email format and required fields).

---

**Testing:**
- The form works well for collecting data, but it doesn’t actually submit anything yet (no server-side action).
- The page is simple and functional but lacks CSS, making it visually basic.

---

**Improvements:**
- Adding **CSS** would improve the design.
- **Back-end** functionality is needed for submitting data.
- **JavaScript** can enhance user experience with features like real-time validation.

---

**Conclusion:**
This page is a simple, functional starting point for a user registration form. It’s ready for improvements, such as styling and back-end integration.
